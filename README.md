# Perception_Visual-Odometry
In this project, the trajectory of the camera is plotted by estimating the 3-D motion of the camera. The frames of the driving sequence and the required scripts are provided to prepare the input dataset. Visual Odometry is a crucial concept in Robotics Perception for estimating the trajectory of the robot (the camera on the robot to be precise). The concepts involved in Visual Odometry are quite the same for SLAM which needless to say is an integral part of Perception.

	

The Python scriptfiles can be directly run to visualize the output.

The details of the project can be obtained from the attched Report.
